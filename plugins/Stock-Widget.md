Collapsible stock widget with options to view percent change for that day, the last five days, or the past month. Refreshes every 10 minutes or when the "refresh" button is clicked. The stocks displayed can be configured using a JSON file. Clicking a stock will set it as the top option, such that it displays even when the rest of the dropdown is collapsed.
