The only modification to sketchybar necessary is to lower the non-topmost windows. Here is the commit: https://github.com/erics118/SketchyBar/commit/120f90d6c753995fcdd11b035c6c40461a2150ef

I've made a quick repo that uses a separate instance of sketchybar, sketchydate, so that it can be used independent of the actual bar. This isn't necessary though.
