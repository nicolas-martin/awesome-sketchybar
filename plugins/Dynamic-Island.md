# "Dynamic Island"

Not sure if this should go under share your setups or here. It's a "plugin" made for MacBooks with a notch. I have somewhat recreated the Dynamic Island feature on iPhone 14 Pros for macOS using SketchyBar. It still in early stage of development so it's very rough and buggy, but the idea and the concept is there. I'll be continuously working on the configs and keep adding more features.
